# OTTD-2cc-in-NML-Mass-Replacement
Performs mass replacements on 2cc Train Set in NML sources.

Very crude, very silly. You have been warned!

There's a hardcoded source path currently. This repo was committed to show what i have been doing, not necessarily for reuse.
But feel free to branch this and alter it to your hearts content. I would license it under some free, open and public license. But i can't be bothered with such trivial matters.

Note, requires CC (C Compiler) and NMLC (OTTD NML Compiler) in system PATH to operate!
